# Music Quiz Game

This project is a simple music-based quiz game for practicing various subjects. It runs entirely in the browser. All quiz answers are stored in `questions.json` and loaded dynamically.

## Linting

This repository uses ESLint (and optionally Prettier) to keep the code clean.

To check the code style, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will analyze JavaScript and HTML files using the configuration provided in `eslint.config.js`.
